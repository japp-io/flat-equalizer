## Introduction

The Flat Equalizer app is designed to enhance your audio experience on Android devices by providing a variety of audio effects that allow you to finely adjust your audio output. Whether you're an audiophile or someone who simply enjoys quality sound, the app offers a range of tools to tailor your music to your preferences.

## Quick Start

Get started quickly with the Flat Equalizer app by following these steps:

1. **Enable Audio Effects**: Before opening your music player, make sure to enable an audio effect from the Equalizer, Bass Boost, Loudness, Virtualizer, Reverb, or Channel Balance options.

2. **Connect to Music Player**: The Equalizer automatically attaches itself to the currently playing music player. While most music players allow the app to apply effects, some might require additional configuration. In such cases, the app will attach itself to the Global Mix to support these players.

3. **Optimize for Music Apps**: For Spotify or YouTube Music users, it's recommended to restart these apps while keeping the equalizer or any effect enabled to ensure optimal compatibility.

4. **Battery Optimization**: For a seamless experience, disable all battery optimizations for the Flat Equalizer app in your device settings.

5. **Supported Music Players**: Refer to the [Supported & Unsupported Media Players](https://japp-io.github.io/flat-equalizer/supported-and-unsupported-music-players) section to see which music players are compatible with the app's effects.
