# User Guide

Welcome to the user guide for the Flat Equalizer app! This guide will walk you through how to make the most of the app's features to enhance your audio experience on Android devices.

## Equalizer

The Equalizer is a powerful tool that lets you fine-tune your audio to suit your preferences. It provides a range of adjustments, allowing you to modify different frequencies in your music. You can adjust up to 10 bands (limited to 5 bands on Android 8 and below). Each slider corresponds to a specific frequency range. Here's how to use it:

- **Balance Frequencies**: If your music sounds uneven, you can use the sliders to balance the different frequencies. Move the sliders up or down to adjust the bass, midrange, and treble.
- **Enhance Bass and Treble**: Boosting the lower frequencies (bass) can give your music a deeper and more thumping feel. Boosting the higher frequencies (treble) adds more sparkle and clarity.
- **Presets**: Choose from various presets designed for different types of music, like classical, hip-hop, or rock. If you're unsure where to start, these presets can be a great help.

### Bass Boost

Activate the Bass Boost effect to make the low-end frequencies in your music more pronounced. This adds a satisfying rumble and depth to your listening experience.

### Loudness

The Loudness effect increases the overall volume of your music. It can make your tracks sound more impactful, but be careful not to set it too high, as it may cause distortion or discomfort.

### Virtualizer

Immerse yourself in your music with the Virtualizer effect. It makes the sound feel more spacious, creating a sense that the audio is coming from various directions.

### Reverberation

The Reverberation effect adds a sense of space to your music, making it feel like you're listening in a larger room. You can choose different room sizes to match your preference.

### Channel Balance

Adjust the volume balance between the left and right audio channels. This feature is handy if you're not sitting in the center of your speakers or if your headphones have differences in volume between the left and right sides. It can also help prevent volume fluctuations caused by certain phones' limiters.

- **Channel Gain**: Use this setting to fine-tune the balance between the left and right channels.

Remember, the key to a great audio experience is experimentation. Try different settings and combinations to find what sounds best to you. Feel free to explore and adjust until you achieve the desired sound quality.
