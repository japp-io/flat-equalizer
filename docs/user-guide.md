# User Guide

Welcome to the user guide for the Flat Equalizer app! This guide will walk you through how to make the most of the app's features to enhance your audio experience on Android devices.

## Equalizer

The Equalizer is a powerful tool that lets you fine-tune your audio to suit your preferences. It provides a range of adjustments, allowing you to modify different frequencies in your music. You can adjust up to 10 bands (limited to 5 bands on Android 8 and below). Each slider corresponds to a specific frequency range. Here's how to use it:

- **Balance Frequencies**: If your music sounds uneven, you can use the sliders to balance the different frequencies. Move the sliders up or down to adjust the bass, midrange, and treble.
- **Enhance Bass and Treble**: Boosting the lower frequencies (bass) can give your music a deeper and more thumping feel. Boosting the higher frequencies (treble) adds more sparkle and clarity.
- **Presets**: Choose from various presets designed for different types of music, like classical, hip-hop, or rock. If you're unsure where to start, these presets can be a great help.

### Bass Boost

Activate the Bass Boost effect to make the low-end frequencies in your music more pronounced. This adds a satisfying rumble and depth to your listening experience.

### Loudness

The Loudness effect increases the overall volume of your music. It can make your tracks sound more impactful, but be careful not to set it too high, as it may cause distortion or discomfort.

### Virtualizer

Immerse yourself in your music with the Virtualizer effect. It makes the sound feel more spacious, creating a sense that the audio is coming from various directions.

### Reverberation

The Reverberation effect adds a sense of space to your music, making it feel like you're listening in a larger room. You can choose different room sizes to match your preference.

### Channel Balance

Adjust the volume balance between the left and right audio channels. This feature is handy if you're not sitting in the center of your speakers or if your headphones have differences in volume between the left and right sides. It can also help prevent volume fluctuations caused by certain phones' limiters.

- **Channel Gain**: Use this setting to fine-tune the balance between the left and right channels.

Remember, the key to a great audio experience is experimentation. Try different settings and combinations to find what sounds best to you. Feel free to explore and adjust until you achieve the desired sound quality.

### Profiles

Profiles are like customized sound settings that you can save and switch between whenever you want. Imagine you're using your car's Bluetooth system â€“ you'd probably prefer a different sound style compared to when you're using your Bluetooth headphones. With profiles, you can easily save these different settings.

You can create a new profile by tapping the "New profile" button at the bottom or by selecting "Save As Profile" from the 3-dot menu. Each profile can be set to activate automatically based on the device you're using. For example, if you have a specific profile for your car's Bluetooth, it will be automatically applied when you connect to it.

Once a profile is applied automatically, it will stay active even if you disconnect the device. It will only change if you have another profile set to automatically apply for a different device, like "Speaker." This means that once you switch to a profile using the auto-apply feature, it'll stay that way until another auto-apply profile takes over, or you manually apply a different profile.

If you'd like to turn off all the equalizer effects when you disconnect your Bluetooth device or headphones, you can create a new profile with all effects disabled. Set this profile to auto-apply when connected to a "Speaker," and it will ensure that no effects are active when you're not using your Bluetooth gear.

You can even share your profiles with friends and family. Just tap the bottom profile button and select "Share Profile." It'll generate a link to share with them. When they tap on the link, your profile will be applied to their device.

This way, you can have different sound setups for different situations and devices, making your audio experience exactly how you want it.
