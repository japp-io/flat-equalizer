# Welcome to Flat Equalizer

This documentation provides detailed information about using the Flat Equalizer - Bass Booster app to enhance your audio experience on Android devices.

## Quick Start

**Flat Equalizer** comes equipped with an array of audio effects that empower you to finely adjust your audio output on your Android device. These effects encompass:

- **Equalizer**: Tailor audio frequencies to craft your personalized sound profile.
- **Bass Boost**: Amplify bass frequencies for a richer and more immersive audio experience.
- **Loudness**: Elevate the overall volume and audio presence, but exercise caution.
- **Virtualizer**: Immerse yourself in a spatial audio environment that widens the stereo image.
- **Reverb**: Enable this effect in settings to add a sense of room acoustics to your audio.
- **Channel Balance**: Fine-tune the balance between left and right audio channels for optimal listening.

Before opening your music player, ensure that you enable an audio effect to experience the enhancements.

Equalizer automatically connects to the currently playing music player. While most music players allow external apps to apply effects, some might need [additional configuration](/supported-and-unsupported-music-players), and some may not support external modifications. In such cases, Equalizer attaches itself to the **Global Mix** to support these players (please note that this may not work on all devices).

For users of Spotify or YouTube Music, it's recommended to restart these apps while keeping the equalizer or any effect enabled.

The app will provide a notification when it detects a music player. Simply tap the notification to attach the equalizer to that specific music player.

To enhance your experience further, it's advised to disable all battery optimizations for the Flat Equalizer app.

For a list of supported and unsupported music players, refer to [Supported & Unsupported Media Players](/supported-and-unsupported-music-players).
