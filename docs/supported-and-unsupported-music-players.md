# Supported and Unsupported Music Players

Most music players let other apps to apply effects to their songs, some require [additional configuration](../supported-and-unsupported-music-players/#requires-additional-configuration), but some do not allow other apps to apply effects to their songs. In such cases, Equalizer will attach itself to the __Global Mix__ as a fallback to support these players, eg. YouTube (this may not work on all the devices).

### Request Support for a Music Player

In order for Equalizer to attach to a music player, the player needs to broadcast its music session ID, allowing apps like Equalizer to apply effects. However, some music players like Amazon Music, YouTube, etc. do not send this broadcast, which prevents Equalizer from working with them. To improve the Android community, you can help by requesting unsupported apps to implement this feature. You can use the following email template:

```
Subject: Request for Equalizer Compatibility

Dear developers,

I am a regular user of your music app and an audiophile. I enjoy customizing my music's sound profile using apps like Flat Equalizer. Unfortunately, your music player does not broadcast the session ID of the currently playing music, preventing Equalizer from working effectively. I kindly request you to implement this feature, which would greatly enhance the audio experience for your users.

Other music players like Spotify and YouTube Music support this feature, and I believe it would greatly benefit your app's users as well. Implementing these two broadcasts should enable Equalizer to apply effects:

1. android.media.action.OPEN_AUDIO_EFFECT_CONTROL_SESSION
2. android.media.action.CLOSE_AUDIO_EFFECT_CONTROL_SESSION

I hope you consider adding this functionality, allowing audiophiles like me to enjoy our music with even greater satisfaction.

Thank you for your attention.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

This collaborative effort can make a significant difference in improving the audio experience for all users.
