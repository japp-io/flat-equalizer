To improve the Android community, you can help by requesting unsupported apps to implement this feature. You can use the following email template:</p> <pre><code>Subject: Request for Equalizer Compatibility\n\nDear developers,\n\nI am a regular user of your music app and an audiophile. I enjoy customizing my music's sound profile using apps like Flat Equalizer. Unfortunately, your music player does not broadcast the session ID of the currently playing music, preventing Equalizer from working effectively. I kindly request you to implement this feature, which would greatly enhance the audio experience for your users.\n\nOther music players like Spotify and YouTube Music support this feature, and I believe it would greatly benefit your app's users as well. Implementing these two broadcasts should enable Equalizer to apply effects:\n\n1. android.media.action.OPEN_AUDIO_EFFECT_CONTROL_SESSION\n2. android.media.action.CLOSE_AUDIO_EFFECT_CONTROL_SESSION\n\nI hope you consider adding this functionality, allowing audiophiles like me to enjoy our music with even greater satisfaction.\n\nThank you for your attention.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n</code></pre> <p>This collaborative effort can make a significant difference in improving the audio experience for all users.</p>"},{"location":"troubleshoot/","title":"Troubleshooting","text":"<p>If you encounter issues while using the Flat Equalizer app, refer to the following troubleshooting tips to resolve common problems:</p>"},{"location":"troubleshoot/#flat-equalizer-effects-not-working","title":"Flat Equalizer Effects Not Working","text":"<p>Equalizer attaches itself to the media player that is currently playing.

It provides a range of adjustments, allowing you to modify different frequencies in your music. You can adjust up to 10 bands (limited to 5 bands on Android 8 and below). Each slider corresponds to a specific frequency range. Here's how to use it:</p> <ul> <li>Balance Frequencies: If your music sounds uneven, you can use the sliders to balance the different frequencies. Move the sliders up or down to adjust the bass, midrange, and treble.</li> <li>Enhance Bass and Treble: Boosting the lower frequencies (bass) can give your music a deeper and more thumping feel. Boosting the higher frequencies (treble) adds more sparkle and clarity.</li> <li>Presets: Choose from various presets designed for different types of music, like classical, hip-hop, or rock. If you're unsure where to start, these presets can be a great help.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"user-guide/#bass-boost","title":"Bass Boost","text":"<p>Activate the Bass Boost effect to make the low-end frequencies in your music more pronounced.

Imagine you're using your car's Bluetooth system \u2013 you'd probably prefer a different sound style compared to when you're using your Bluetooth headphones. With profiles, you can easily save these different settings.</p> <p>You can create a new profile by tapping the \"New profile\" button at the bottom or by selecting \"Save As Profile\" from the 3-dot menu. Each profile can be set to activate automatically based on the device you're using. For example, if you have a specific profile for your car's Bluetooth, it will be automatically applied when you connect to it.</p> <p>Once a profile is applied automatically, it will stay active even if you disconnect the device. It will only change if you have another profile set to automatically apply for a different device, like \"Speaker.\" This means that once you switch to a profile using the auto-apply feature, it'll stay that way until another auto-apply profile takes over, or you manually apply a different profile.</p> <p>If you wish to disable all equalizer effects upon disconnecting your Bluetooth device or headphones, follow these steps:</p> <ol> <li>Create a new profile with all effects turned off.</li> <li>Configure this profile to automatically apply when connected to a 'Speaker.' This will ensure that no effects are active when your Bluetooth device or headphones are not in use.</li> </ol> <p>However, please be aware of the following implications:</p> <ul> <li>Disabling all effects will halt the Equalizer background service to improve battery life.</li> <li>Consequently, the auto-apply feature will also become inactive, requiring manual intervention to apply the settings again.</li> <li>To address this, consider enabling only the bass boost effect and setting it to 0%. This approach will keep the service active and maintain the functionality of the auto-apply feature.</li> </ul> <p>You can also share your profiles with friends and family. Just tap the bottom profile button and select \"Share Profile.\" It'll generate a link to share with them. When they tap on the link, your profile will be applied to their device.</p> <p>This way, you can have different sound setups for different situations and devices, making your audio experience exactly how you want it.</p> <p>If you have any further questions or need assistance, don't hesitate to contact us at support@japp.io.</p> <p>Note: The above explanations are meant to provide a simple overview of the Flat Equalizer's features.
